            <h3 class="fw-bold">What is DPO?</h3>
            <p>
               Data protection Officers (DPO’s) act as an independent advocate for the proper care and use of customer’s information. The role of a data protection officer was formally laid out by the European Union as part of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data protection officer keeps up on laws and practices around data protection, conducts privacy assessments internally, and ensures that all other matters of compliance pertaining to data are up-to-date.
